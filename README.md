# WebCrawler Template
Created this repository to upgrade my older low-code / Selenium Crawlers to Typescript and test other libraries to get the job done.

## Research
During my research I found out that Selenium is the standard for performance, but Puppeteer would be the faster and also the fastest one.
However, Cypress could be a better approach in this case, even if looks like the slowest of the the options, because it's supposed to be the easiest one.

## Installation
Currently it's possible to run this on my WSL2 environment on Windows 11, probably because of the update of the WSLg. Should work out of the box, but if it doesn't work, try install Google Chrome from terminal and use some gui app from terminal.

## Roadmap
[x] Setup the typescript project from scratch
[x] Write basic template with Puppetter
[] Write basic template with Cypress
[] Write one of the real world crawlers and choose a language
